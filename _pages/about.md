Hi, thanks for visiting! ü§ù

I am currently a research scientist at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University (NYU). My interdisciplinary research integrates climate dynamics, physical oceanography, climate/ocean modeling, and data analysis to explore the complexities of climate change. My work centers on understanding the ocean‚Äôs role in a changing climate and the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean, focusing on the transfer of heat, momentum, and gases. I utilize climate-relevant observations to corroborate results from large suites of global climate models, design numerical experiments to understand the climate and ocean dynamics, and apply advanced statistical methods to large datasets and model outputs to estimate human-induced "fingerprints."

I earned my Ph.D. in Oceanography from the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) (SIO), UC San Diego, under the supervision of Prof. Lynne D. Talley and Prof. Shang-Ping Xie. My dissertation, titled ‚ÄúResponses of the Southern Ocean in a Changing Climate," explored the changes of temperature, salinity, and [large-scale circulations in the Southern Ocean](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01212-5) in response to surface buoyancy and wind forcing. I also hold a M.S. in Oceanography from SIO and both M.Eng. and B.Eng. degrees in Ocean Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/shanghai-jiao-tong-university).

Prior to my current position, I was a Postdoctoral Investigator at [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) (WHOI), working with Dr. Young-Oh Kwon, Dr. Susan Wijffels, and Dr. Benjamin Santer. There, I led a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded proposal aimed at investigating the ocean‚Äôs forced responses to different climate forcings. This research primarily focuses on understanding the [climate effects of anthropogenic aerosols](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0656.1), tracing how climate signals propagate from the surface to the interior ocean using observational datasets and comprehensive global climate models, and identifying [human influences on seasonal climate cycles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01958-8).
